  I have decided to write a beginners guide to 3d printing. I think it is a common trend that people\
  will buy a 3d printer with great intentions only to abandon it when things start to go wrong! There have been so many times\
  that I have wanted to throw my printer out a window! Failed prints become less frequent with experience but I think a simple guide could help to reduce the learning curve.<p>\
  With that being said, from my experience, I think there is a lot of advice and support available which can help overcome nearly every issue with\
  3d printing that any beginner might encounter. Taking time to calibrate every 3d printer can make a huge difference in the quality of results. I will try to make this guide general so it can be applicable\
  to as many 3d printers as possible.\

  This will cover:<p>FILAMENT, CALIBRATION, TEMPERATURE, SIMPLE PRINTS<p>\
