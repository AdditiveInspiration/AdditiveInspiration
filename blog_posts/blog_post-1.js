<!TEXT!><p><p>\
I have always followed new trends in technology closely but none have ever inspired me as much as 3d printing. Making digital objects\
 physical seems like something from a science fiction movie! As an Engineer, I respect the complexity of 3d printers which represent\
 the ultimate crossover of mechanical and electronic engineering.<p>\
 I have bought a new 3d printer with the expectation that I can use it to make quick prototypes for the electronic projects that I do in my spare\
 time. I have been researching the market for a long time to decide what 3d printer I should buy. Without a lot of money in my budget I have settled on a\
 DIY 3d printer kit. The kit I chose has a strong community built around it which I am hoping will help when things inevitably go up in smoke..hopefully not literally!. The Tevo Black Widow,\
 available from AliExpress, has a strong hobbyist community built up around it and appears to be capable..in the right hands..of producing accurate 3d prints.\

<p> When my order arrived it took the guts of a weekend to build. The instructions were relatively unclear but with the aid of the 3d printing community and some\
 youtube videos the Black Widow was up and running!\
