I have been experimenting with the 3d printer a lot. It is a fantastic tool to make all sorts of prototypes\
 However, there are still a lot of limitations with printers from every price range. The more practice I get, the more and more consistant\
 results I achieve. I have been looking into ways to upgrade the printer to increase functionality for a long time and I have decided to do one\
 upgrade in particular: Add a laser engraver.<p>\
 I have been trying to make custom board games recently..having designed some settlers of catan models I am getting tired of the time it takes\
 to do even small prints! With this in mind I have decided to write a guide on adding a laser engraver to any 3d printer. It is actually quite simple..\
 3d printers are composed of a hot end, extruder and a way to move a carriage along the x, y and z axis. Simply adding a laser module to the moving carriage and\
 fixing the z axis (height) to the focal length of the laser will allow you to etch most materials with computer precision. THIS POST IS A LITTLE MORE DANGEROUS SO DO NOT TRY THIS IF YOU\
 DONT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY EYE INJURIES\
