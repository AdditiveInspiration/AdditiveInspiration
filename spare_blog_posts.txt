                             Having just bought and built a new 3d printer we have decided to start a 3d printing blog! We're two engineers, trained in the same university but with very different skills - hopefully which will complement each other! Andrew is significantly more
                             experienced with 3d printers and should be able to help reduce the steep learning curve it takes to become a 3d printing machine.<p> I'm excited - I have read every website, article, facebook group - which has prepared me for the frustrations that a cheap 3d printing 
                             kit can cause. We decided to buy a tevo black widow kit - It was well reviewed and relatively good value.<p> I'm pleased to report it was delivered quickly, in a very big and heavy box! 
                             Taking it out of the box I was holding my breath, expecting an incomplete kit of cheap and assorted parts. Wish us luck in the assembly and post any tips/experiences in the comments section below! I have included stock photos of the ultimate 3d printing benchmarks - the benchy and an xyz calibration cube! Hopefully our printer can produce similar results as shown above!
